The **Voidwaker** is one of the most powerful special attack weapons in _Old School RuneScape_, known for its unique ability to deal a **guaranteed high-damage hit** split between magic and melee. This makes it a deadly weapon in PvP scenarios and great for PvM encounters against bosses with high defence.

## How to get the Voidwaker?

The Voidwaker is assembled from three pieces:

1. Voidwaker Blade 
2. Voidwaker Hilt 
3. Voidwaker Gem 

Each piece is dropped by a high-level **Wilderness boss** at a rate of 1/360 or its safer variant in the singles+ caves below level 30 wildernss at a rate of 1/912. Once youâ€™ve obtained all three pieces, you can **combine them** by speaking to _Madam Sikaro_ in the _Ferox Enclave_ dungeon for a fee of 500,000 coins.
