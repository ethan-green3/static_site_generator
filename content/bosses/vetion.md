**Vet'ion/Cavar'ion** is a powerful skeletal boss deep in the Wilderness that drops the **Voidwaker Blade**. A safer singles+ alternative is **Calvar'ion**, located in the boss cave.

## Overview

**Vet'ion/Calvar'ion have several attacks and abilities**

- Magic attack: Five bolts of lightning strike various tiles across the arena, much like the Grotesque Guardians' lightning attack. Each lightning bolt deals damage in a 3x3 area, but any tile that is about to be struck glows, giving players the chance to dodge the attack. When soloing, one bolt will always target the player's tile or an adjacent tile, while four more will target random tiles around the arena. In groups, one bolt will appear for every player in the chamber, capped at seven.
- Hellhounds: Upon reaching half health, Vet'ion will summon two skeletal hellhounds to attack players. They attack with melee, so activate Protect from Melee when they spawn or keep it active during the fight. They will provide him with complete damage immunity while present. He will do the same again in his enraged form.
- Shield Bash: Vet'ion will raise his shield to bash an area in front or around and underneath him; shadows will appear forewarning the AoE of the attack. If the player doesn't move out of range, they'll take up to 35 damage and be unable to attack for the next 4.8 seconds. This attack is only used when in melee distance.
- Enraged Form: Upon losing all health in his first form, Vet'ion will summon orange lightning bolts (which share his standard lightning bolts' 3x3 area damage) in a circle around him and restore his health to full. In his second form, the hellhound mechanic is repeated, but he will die after losing all of his health in this form.
