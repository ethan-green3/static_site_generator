A safer alternative, <b>Spindel</b>, exists in the singles+ cave.</p><h2>Location</h2><ul><li><b>Venenatis</b>: Silk Chasm - Level 35 Wildy</li><li><b>Spindel</b>: Web Chasm - Level 29 Wildy</li></ul><h2>Drop Rate</h2><ul><li><b>Venenatis</b>: 1/360 for Voidwaker Hilt</li><li><b>Spindel</b>: 1/912 for Voidwaker Hilt</li></ul><h2>Overview</h2><ul><li>Venenatis can attack with all three forms of combat. While she will only use one combat style at a time, players in melee distance will instead only be attacked by melee. Like Vet'ion, she is weakest to crush.</li><li>She will begin the fight using 8 range attacks, followed by 8 magic attacks, all while moving position every 4 attacks. She will spawn spiderlings on the 1st range attack in cycle, and deploy her web attack on the 3rd mage attack in the cycle. This pattern will repeat until Venenatis is defeated.</li><li>All players who enter the arena will appear to the north, so it is recommended to hang south as much as possible to escape player killers, as she is no longer under level 30 Wilderness following the 25 January 2023 update. This does not apply to the weaker variant of the boss, Spindel, as her lair is still below level 30 Wilderness and can be teleported out of directly.</li><li>Players should avoid the webs at all costs, as their ability to drain run energy will prevent them from escaping from player killers.</li><li>The web can be positioned safely by standing on the outskirt of the arena on the 3rd magic attack to help prevent accidentally walking into the web.</li><li>The spiderlings should be killed as soon as they spawn to prevent them from empowering her too much; fortunately, they only have 5 health and can be killed in one hit by any combat style.</li><li>Darts or Throwing knives can quickly eliminate individual spiderlings.</li></ul><p><i>Credit to the OSRS wiki</i></p><h2>Recommended Gear</h2><p><b>Never bring gear you aren't willing to lose outside of your 3 protected items</b></p><p><i>This is the set up I went with</i></p><h3>Melee Setup (Not including bis, can bring better melee str gear if you want)</h3><ul><li>Helm of neitiznot (Slayer helm if on task)</li><li>Amulet of Glory</li><li>Fire cape (Can lock with trouver parchment)</li><li>Black d'hide body</li><li>Black d'hide legs</li><li>Ursine Chainmace</li><li>Dragon Defender (Can lock with trouver parchment)</li><li>Rada Blessing</li><li>Barrows Gloves</li><li>Dragon Boots</li><li>Berserker Ring (i)</li></ul><h3>Ranged Setup (Melee is recommended)</h3><ul><li>Blessed coif (Slayer helm (i) if on task)</li><li>Necklace of Anguish</li><li>Ava's assembler</li><li>Black d'hide body</li><li>Black d'hide legs</li><li>Webweaver/Craws bow</li><li>Rada blessing</li><li>Barrows Gloves</li><li>Snakeskin boots</li><li>Ring of shadows</li></ul><p> <i>Inventory Setup</i></p><ul><li>Looting Bag</li><li>Royal Seed Pod</li><li>Super Combat Potion (Ranging potion if ranging)</li><li>4-5 Blighted Super Restores</li><li>Darts/knives for spiderlings</li><li>Rest high healing food</li></ul><p><a href="../index.html">< Back to home page</a></p></div></article>
