This has AoE capabilities and deals massive damage; using Protect from Melee reduces the damage by ~50%.</li><li>Ranged: Artio launches crescent-shaped projectiles at everyone in the den if she cannot attack with melee.</li><li>Knockback: Artio will launch a white orb-like projectile at a targeted player, which will send them flying backwards and inflict damage if Protect from Magic is not activated when the attack visually hits the player.</li><li>The knockback attack is a single-target attack with splash AOE. This means that it will only target one player, but the spell will affect all players within a 3x3 square of the targeted player when it hits.</li><li>The damage the player will take from this attack when it hits them off prayer depends on how far the player can be knocked back before they hit an object (the walls of the arena or any bear traps on the floor). The attack will attempt to knock the player back 3 tiles. If the player can be knocked back the full 3 tiles without hitting an object, they will take 5 damage. This scales up by 15 damage for each tile of knockback that cannot be completed, so the player will take 20 damage if they were 2 tiles away from an object they were pushed into, and 35 damage if they were 1 tile away. If the player is directly next to an object that the attack pushes them into, they will take 50 damage.</li><li>Bear Traps: At 66% health, Artio will deploy red, ghostly-like bear traps around the arena. Getting caught in a trap will deal up to 15 damage and briefly bind the player. The traps will be redeployed again at ~33% health and appear afterwards with every attack she makes.</li></ul><h2>Strategy</h2><p>- Artio will spawn to the south of the den, right in front of the exit. If you wish to avoid player killers, it is recommended to place a secondary account waiting outside the entrance to scout potential threats. All players who enter the den will spawn to the north, similar to Callisto's lair. - Artio uses highly damaging melee attacks and is weakest to magic and ranged attacks. Ice spells will land often even with minimal magic gear, binding her temporarily. If she cannot attack with melee, she will begin using a much weaker ranged attack until she can reach her target. Artio will occasionally launch a white orb at her target, which should be protected against by switching on Protect from Magic or risk taking up to 50 damage from the attack. - Upon reaching 66 and 33% of her health, Artio will roar, launching bear traps all across the arena. Stepping on one will deal up to 15 damage and bind the player for a few seconds. The traps will linger around for a short duration before expiring, but will immediately be replaced with a fresh set of traps. While roaring, she will also glow red, breaking free of binds in the process and requiring a player to refreeze her. -</p><p><i>Credit to the OSRS Wiki</i></p><h2>Recommended Gear</h2><ul><li>Artio can deal incredibly high melee damage through prayer, so melee combat is not advised. Artio is no longer immune to magic damage. Freezing the boss in place is strongly recommended. Binding spells, such as Ice Barrage or Ice Blitz, are commonly used. They are also guaranteed to hit if the player has +0 or higher magic accuracy bonus while Artio is not frozen. Players can use either ranged or magic after freezing the boss. One method involves praying melee and healing with Bloodbark armour and Blood barrage. Players with high Magic and Defence levels will find they are able to heal more with blood barrage than Artio can damage them with melee, making this method very low effort, only requiring occasional eating and drinking prayer potions.</li></ul><p><i>Credit to the OSRS wiki</i></p><p><b>Never bring gear you aren't willing to lose outside of your 3 protected items</b></p><p><i>This is the set up I went with</i></p><h3>Ranged Setup</h3><ul><li><b>MAKE SURE TO BE AT LEAST 0 MAGIC ACCURACY TO GUARENTEE LANDING FREEZES</b></li><li>Slayer helm if on task, otherwise a helm to get above 0 magic accuracy</li><li>Necklace of Anguish</li><li>Imbued God Cape</li><li>Black d'hide top</li><li>Black d'hide legs</li><li>Webweaver/Craws bow</li><li>Rada Blessing</li><li>Barrows Gloves</li><li>Blessed boots</li><li>Ring of Shadows</li></ul><h3>Magic Setup (More AFK but more costly)</h3><ul><li>Bloodbark helm (Slayer helm if on task)</li><li>Occult Necklace</li><li>Imbued God Cape</li><li>Bloodbark Body</li><li>Bloodbark legs</li><li>Accursed Sceptre</li><li>Elidinis Ward</li><li>Rada Blessing</li><li>Tormented Bracelet</li><li>Bloodbark Boots</li><li>Ring of Shadows</li></ul><p><i>Inventory Setup</i></p><ul><li>~150 Blighted Ice Sacks if ranging, Runes for blood barrage if maging</li><li>4-5 Blighted Super Restores</li><li>Looting Bag</li><li>Royal Seed Pod</li><li>2-3 Ranging Potions if ranging</li><li>Rest high healing food</li></ul><p><a href="/static_site_generator/">< Back to Home Page</a></p></div></article>
